# Java-Scraper

This repository contains the source code for a Java-Webscraper, which scrapes item data from an e-commerce website. The application features a GUI for easier user-experience, and makes use of multi-threading with the option of adding user-provided proxies for enhanced performance.

The resulting data is saved in csv format to the program's root folder, to allow for access to previous searches.
